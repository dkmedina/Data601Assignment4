### Key Trends in Energy Consumption and Efficiency
  The analysis of the City of Calgary Building Energy Benchmarking Dataset revealed some interesting insights into patterns across various property types. One key observation is the strong variation in Site Energy 
  Use Intensity, or (EUI), across property types. Large facilities such as distribution centres had a much higher average EUI versus Offices or even indoor arenas. The most interesting findings coming
  out of the EUI visualization though is the Fitness Centre/Gym and Heated Swimming Pools, as these are the highest EUI / Square Meter by all property types by far. Ice Rinks are also in the top 
  of the largest EUI. This key trend shows that buildings where they have to maintain a certain temperature also has the highest EUI / Square Meter by Property Type. 



### Seasonal and Property Type Trends
  Seasonal patterns in energy consumption is very evident, as Calgary is a winter city where it is negative temperatures in the majority of months in a year, we expect to see heating and cooling be affected by this, therefore energy is highly affected as well.
  For example, from the time series analysis conducted, we can see COVID-19 had a huge impact on energy usage, as most of these property types were service/commercial based, with everything shut down the energy consumption dropped significantly until the mandates started to end.
  This is where the energy consumption shot up again, but not as high as we once saw pre-COVID-19. Also, from the time series graph we can see that as the year goes on and winter ends, energy site EUI drops going into the warmer months, and shoots up again at the start of every year.
  This makes sense since the year starts in January, typically one of the coldest months of the entire year in Alberta. We can see property types such as leisure and municiple centres, large commercial facilities, and multi-service centres consuming the highest GHG emissions. 

### Recommendations for Improving Energy Efficiency

- Focus on high-emission properties
  - We should prioritize maintenance and renovations for the high-emission properties, where we could upgrade insulation for winter heating, lighting systems, and HVAC units to more energy-efficient alternatives or technology to improve usage
- Implement Renewable Energy Solutions
  - Encourage the adoption of renewable energy solutions such as solar panels or more efficient ways of heating by implementing subsidies to property/business owners who invest in such infrastructure.
- Seasonal Efficiency Programs
  - We could launch seasonal energy-saving programs during the high-intensity months such as November-January focusing on over-consumption of energy
- Establish Stricter building codes
- Limit future building sizes
  - The correlation matrix showed strong correlations between GHG emissions and building sizes, as well as site energy use and building size, if we can limit some building sizes going forward we can limit potential areas of high GHG emissions and energy use.
